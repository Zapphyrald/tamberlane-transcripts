PENNY: Our trap worked! They'll never catch us now!
TAMBERLANE: Bwoo!

PENNY: Oh, are you worried about my Papa?
TAMBERLANE: Owie!

PENNY: Don't worry about him.
PENNY: He's a sturdy bloke. He'll survive.

PENNY: Now let's run, before we get caught!

PENNY: I said, let's run!
TAMBERLANE: Okie!

PENNY: Ugh! I'm starting to think you don't even know how to *walk,* much less *run!*
TAMBERLANE: Ugh!

PENNY: Guuhh... Fine, it's okay.
PENNY: We'll just teach you how to walk, too.

PENNY: Just hurry! I don't wanna get caught! 
PENNY: Cor blimey, I can't believe you're three.
