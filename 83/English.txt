NORA: If you haven't noticed, Penny is missing, too.

NORA: Just this morning, she was trying to get my attention.

NORA: So I snapped at her.
NORA: ***PENNY!*** Quit it! Mummy's busy right now!

NORA: And I *know* I shouldn't think things like that...
NORA: But she only wanted my attention for a *moment.*
NORA: Did I *have* to shout at her?

NORA: There's no rulebook for *any* of us, Bel.
