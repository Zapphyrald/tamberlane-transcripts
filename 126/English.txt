MILO: You wanted me to look at something?

OAKEWOOD: This is Tamberlane. Belfry Baker found her in the forest and adopted her.
OAKEWOOD: But we haven't the faintest clue what she is.
OAKEWOOD: We were wondering if you might have seen anything like her in your studies.

MILO: How fascinating! May I examine you?

TAMBERLANE: OkAGH!
MILO: Omnivorous dentition...

MILO: Unusual fur pattern... And she's unlike anything I've read about.
MILO: She's perfect!

OAKEWOOD: Now hold on a tick!
OAKEWOOD: What do you mean, "*perfect*"?

MILO: For my *research project!*
