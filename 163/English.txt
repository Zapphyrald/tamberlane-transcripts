MILO, TAMBERLANE & OAKEWOOD: Abroad?

OAKEWOOD: That's absolute tosh.

TAGG: Before you dismiss me, hear me out.
TAGG: There's something strange happening Abroad.

DANGER: Areas are blocked off or quarantined. No one will say why. 

TAGG: And creatures from Follybrook are vanishing.

OAKEWOOD: Come now! This has *nothing* to do with Tamberlane!
OAKEWOOD: Quarantines? Missing creatures? Utter poppy!

TAGG: Something's happening in Abroad, and I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with *her!*
