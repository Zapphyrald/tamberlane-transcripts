BELFRY: What's *she* want?
BRIAR: Come on, don't bite the messenger. You know how mum gets.

BRIAR: Look. She just wanted me to ask you to help out at the booth tomorrow at the festival.

BELFRY:  You tell Mum that if she wants me at the booth, she can come here and ask me *herself!*

BELFRY: Isn't that just *so like her?*
BELFRY: Sending my little sister to do her *dirty work!*

BELFRY: Couldn't come and *talk to me, oh no!*

BRIAR: Bel, *stop!*
BRIAR: Come on!

BRIAR: Don't you think all this is a *little* silly?
