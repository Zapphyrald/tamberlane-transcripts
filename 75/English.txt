TAMBERLANE: Penny!

PENNY: I was so worried!
PENNY: Don't cry, Tam! I told Piper's mum on her and everything!

PENNY: Oi, Parsley! Y'gotta teach her how to read!
PENNY: She's three and doesn't know how!

MARIE: Shouldn't she learn to talk first?

PARSLEY: Oh, Marie, you didn't notice?
PARSLEY: She speaks Trissol.

PARSLEY: She speaks with her paws, not her mouth.
PARSLEY: Me brother Cilantro does, too.

MARIE & PENNY: ***WHAT?!***
