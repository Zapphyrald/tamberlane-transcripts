PIPER: Whatcha got there?
TAMBERLANE: *AH!!!*

ISAIAH: Didn't your mum put you on rubbish duty?
PIPER: *UGH*, Isaiah! I'm on a *break!* So *sue me!*

ISAIAH: I seem to recall you've been on a "break" three times this morning.

PIPER: Mummy told me to take it easy. Child labor is illegal, you know.

ISAIAH: Hmm, is that so? Perhaps I should ask *Avery* about that.
PIPER: ***YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!!!***
