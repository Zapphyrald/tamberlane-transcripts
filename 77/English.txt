PARSLEY: Where's your mum?

PARSLEY: You don't understand?

PARSLEY: Your mum! You know, warm and soft and feeds you and takes care of you?
PARSLEY: Hugs you when you're scared?
PARSLEY: Still don't understand, huh?
PARSLEY: Never met a kit who didn't know what a *mum* was...

TAMBERLANE: Eh?

PARSLEY: Oh, ah...
PARSLEY: You want to help me? I'm sorry, Tam, I don't quite know what you mean.

PARSLEY: Ah, poor little luv.
PARSLEY: Now I rather wish Cilantro hadn't moved to Three Rivers.
