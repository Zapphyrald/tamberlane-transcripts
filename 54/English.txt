PENNY: So what's your favorite book?
TAMBERLANE: muh?

PENNY: You know, books? Reading?

PENNY: Do you even know *how* to read?

PENNY: How old are you?
TAMBERLANE: Tree.
PENNY: Wow! Me too! But you don't know how to read yet?
PENNY: But I thought kits were s'posed to read before three.

PENNY: Well...that's okay!

PENNY: Mum says all creatures grow at their own pace.

PENNY: Y'know, Parsley's quite good at teaching little kits how to read.

PENNY: Let's go find him!

PENNY: Follow my lead.
