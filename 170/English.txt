BELFRY: I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HER IN THE WOODS!
TESS: No, I KNOW that! I...

TESS: This isn't coming out right.
BRIAR: Belfry, let Mum talk.

TESS: Bel, my darling waif, you have to understand that I'm...scared.
TESS: I'm scared of losing you.

BELFRY: *Losing* me? Where would I even *go?!*

TESS: To Abroad, Belfry.
TESS: If Tamberlane gets sick - *seriously* sick - I worry our medicine won't be enough. 
TESS: We don't know *anything* about her. She isn't just a normal kit; she has special needs. And that's fine, but...

TESS: If that happens, God forbid, you'll have to make a decision.
TESS: You can stay here with her, keep her safe and comfortable, and watch her die.
TESS: Or... you can take her to Abroad.
BELFRY: Ugh, *Mum!* You're *so* stuck in the past!
