OAKEWOOD: Tamberlane, are you quite alright?

TAMBERLANE: He didn't want help.

OAKEWOOD: No, he did not. Some creatures don't.
TAMBERLANE: But I help.
OAKEWOOD: No, you're a kit. You just *be.*

OAKEWOOD: But aside from helping, are you alright?

TAMBERLANE: Yeah... but is Unca okay?

OAKEWOOD: Yes. But what did I just say?
TAMBERLANE: No help, just be!
OAKEWOOD: Very good.
