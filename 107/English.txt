BELFRY: How about this? I'll write Mum a letter that you can just hand her, and therefore avoid the crossfire?
BRIAR: You know she'll ask me why I didn't try to convince you.

BELFRY: I promise I'll add something in about that.

BRIAR: Yeah, all right.

BRIAR: Thanks, Bel.
BELFRY: Anything for my little монахиня!
BRIAR: Wrong kind of sister, Bel. монахиня means *nun.*
