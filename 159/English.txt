OAKEWOOD: Mx. Tagg, Mr. Danger, if you don't mind a moment of your time, I do have a quandary you might help with...

MILO: *U... Uncle!!*

MILO: Uncle, we're not... we're not supposed to talk to...

OAKEWOOD: *Milo Jamiton, don't be a disrespectful git!!* If your father could hear you today, he'd be *ashamed!*

MILO: b-but... we're not... supposed to...

OAKEWOOD: Have a spine, boy!
MILO: Y...yes, sir.

OAKEWOOD: I apologize for my daft godson. It appears booksmarts do not preclude ignorance.
OAKEWOOD: At any rate, I understand if you don't wish to help, but we need to learn more about Tamberlane.
TAMBERLANE: I'm a Tamberlane!
OAKEWOOD: I only want to know, have you seen anything like her in Follybrook?

TAGG: I just want to go home.
DANGER; Tagg, he *has* been all right to us...
