AVERY: Sure, maternal instinct can *help,* but we're creatures, not animals.
AVERY: We're not *ruled* by our instincts.

AVERY: Have you tried actually *talking* to Tess?
BELFRY: *Of course* I have! Like, *a lot!*

BELFRY: But no matter how many times I talk to her, she's just so *STUBBORN!*

AVERY: Have you tried *listening* to her?

BELFRY: NO! She wants me to *abandon* Tamberlane!

AVERY: Mmm, maybe. 
AVERY: But if you ask me, that doesn't sound like the Tess I know.
AVERY: If you really want to repair this relationship, you need to actually figure out *why* she feels like that.
