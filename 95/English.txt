OAKEWOOD: Well, alright then.  Go put her back.

BELFRY: What?! But I can't do that!

OAKEWOOD: Why not?  You just said you can't do it.
BELFRY: Yeah, but I can't just leave her to *die!*

OAKEWOOD: Fair enough. 
OAKEWOOD: Give her to someone else, then.

BELFRY: But I... they wouldn't...

BELFRY: No one else understands her like...
BELFRY: ...like I do.

OAKEWOOD: My goodness! I guess you'll just have to do it yourself!
