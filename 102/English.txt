BELFRY: Here you go. Eat carefully, okay?

OAKEWOOD: hrmmngghrr

[SFX: SLAM!!]
OAKEWOOD: MORE DEAD ENDS!

OAKEWOOD: It's been almost *four months* and we still know nearly *nothing!*
OAKEWOOD: She's *clearly* met other creatures before but can't remember anything *about* them!
OAKEWOOD: She's growing so quickly, but behaves like a kit half her age! Her Growl sounds like she's choking on a frog!
OAKEWOOD: Maybe her *genus* would explain it, but I can't figure *that* out either!

OAKEWOOD: Does she only eat peas and oatmeal because she's a *child* or because of *digestive adaptation?*
OAKEWOOD: And what happens when peas go out of season, eh?!
OAKEWOOD: *WHAT THEN?*

BELFRY: Well, then we can just feed her oatmeal.
OAKEWOOD: Belfry, for the last time, I need you to listen-
OFFSCREEN: Hey.
OAKEWOOD: She needs more than that.

[SFX: siiigh]
OAKEWOOD: Or you can get distracted. That's fine, too.
