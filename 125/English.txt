OAKEWOOD: Oh. *That* Milo.
MILO: Yeah... it's me.
OAKEWOOD: You've grown.
MILO: Heh, kits often do.

ANTHONY: Who's that?
TAMBERLANE: I dunno!

PIPER: A bird-horse with a *coyote* for an uncle? Does he have an elephant for a mum too??
ANTHONY: ***PIPER!***
TAMBERLANE: I like him!

OAKEWOOD: So...
OAKEWOOD: How's your mother?
MILO: She... actually asked about you!
OAKEWOOD: Pah. Just as rubbish of a liar as when you were young.

MILO: Fair enough.
MILO: But *I* missed you...

PIPER: This is *so boring!*
ANTHONY: I think it's sweet!
TAMBERLANE: Me too!
