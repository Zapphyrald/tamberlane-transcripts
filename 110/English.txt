CAT: Right then; tell me your "foolproof plan" once more?
PIPER: So I'm at the Sovereign Festival in this *lovely* dress you made.
PIPER: Even though you're making me pick up rubbish.
PIPER: Which make NO SENSE, by the way.
CAT: Save it for the judge, poppet.
PIPER: Well, whenever someone admires my dress, I can be all...

PIPER: "Oh, golly gosh, mister! Isn't my dress *just smashing?*"

PIPER: "My *mummy* made it! Isn't she *ever* so talented? I bet your daughter would look *adorable* in one!"

PIPER: "What a *crazy* coincidence!"
PIPER: "She's offering them across the way in Trade Alley!"
PIPER: "Right next to those *scrummy* pies!"
CAT: And *this* is how you're going to get out of being grounded?
PIPER: *FOOLPROOF!*
