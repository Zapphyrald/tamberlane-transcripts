BELFRY: What do you mean?
BRIAR: I mean...

BELFRY: Briar?

BRIAR: I *mean* you need to stop being so *stubborn!*
BRIAR: You and Mum aren't talking *again!*
BRIAR: Papa's had to take over your job at the bakery!
BRIAR: They're arguing every night over dinner!

BRIAR: ***AND I'M STUCK IN THE MIDDLE, LIKE ALWAYS!***

BRIAR: If you fancy yourself a mum, then brilliant!
BRIAR: You do you!

BRIAR: But would you *please* stop being so *bloody difficult?*
BRIAR: Come *home!*
